						<p>
							Wireless earbuds are all the rage right now and it
							feels as though every OEM is digging their toes into
							this space. Oraimo, a renowned smart accessories
							brand in Africa and some Asian markets, continues to
							push out compelling true wireless buds.
						</p>
						<p>
							The team here at Dignited has used many of these
							products and it is about time we consolidated the
							entire lineup for a quick buying guide, to help you
							choose an Oraimo-made wireless earphone that is best
							suited for you.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-spec--1">
						<h3>Oraimo Freepods Pro</h3>
						<p>
							The Oraimo Freepods Pro are the current flagship
							wireless buds from the company. They offer all the
							industry top features like a premium design, Active
							noise cancellation, all at a price of less than
							$100.

					</div>
					<div class="product-spec--2">
						<h3>Oraimo Riff</h3>
						<p>
							On the other end of the price spectrum is the
							<span class="riff">Oraimo Riff</span>. These buds
							cost around $20 and still pack quite a punch. They
							have Bluetooth 5.0 and a rather slim profile
							compared to their siblings. Smaller for comfort is a
							rather apt description of these buds.

								Let the Size Fool You
							</li>
							<li class="riff-unlist">
								Of course, Oraimo had to cut costs to deliver
								these buds for the said price and in my testing,
								I think they did that in the build quality,
								although not that much. They also did cut cost
								on the drivers as the sound stage isn’t as
								elaborate as its pricier siblings but for the
								everyday person, these are just fine.
							</li>
							<li>
								Price:
								<span class="prices">
									KES2,500, ₦11,200, UGX 75,000s

						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="product-spec--3">
						<h3>Oraimo Freepods 3</h3>
						<p>
							My personal daily drivers so you know I am about to
							sound like a sales person. Seriously though, these
							buds have been popular in the market since they
							launched in 2021 and for a good reason. These buds
							offer so much value for money and the sound quality
							is where it’s at.
						</p>
						<img
							src="./images/oraimo--4.jpg"
							alt="spec"
							width="100%"
							class="riff-spec , article-img"
						/>
						<p>
							These charge via a USB-C cable and while the case
							does not hold up well over time, they offer a good
							sound stage, one that has, on numerous occasions,
							been compared to that of the Apple Airpods. Yes,
							they’re pretty good.
						</p>
						<p>
							The bass is punchy, the mids are crisp, the highs
							could use some work but a decent EQ app helps you
							with this rather easily. There’s a reason many
							people use these buds and you bet they’re still
							going to be popular for months to come.
						</p>
						<p>
							Price:
							<span class="prices"
								>₦15,600, KES3,800, UGX 98,000</span
							>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-spec--4">
						<h3>Roll with Tunes</h3>
						<p>
							The Roll with Tunes are the latest addition to
							Oraimo’s portfolio. These have a case design that’s
							pretty different from the ones we’ve seen with the
							Freepods. The case opens in half, vertically as
							opposed to the previous buds that have a lid and a
							neck.
						</p>
						<img
							src="./images/oraimo--5.jpg"
							alt="spec"
							width="100%"
							height="700"
							class="pro-roll , article-img"
						/>
						<p>
							These should appeal to users that loved the design
							of the Freepods 2 as they don’t come with rubber ear
							tips. We haven’t had a chance to test these in-house
							but looking at the price and what Oraimo has been
							doing, we expect decent sound but not as elaborate
							or wholesome as the ENC-enabled options, decent
							build quality, and the same robustness we have come
							to know and love from Oraimo.
						</p>
						<p>
							Price: <span>KES 1999</span>, 16 USD,
							<span>₦9,500</span>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-spec--5">
						<h3>Oraimo Freepods 2 Pro</h3>

						<p>
							The predecessors to the Freepods 3, these Freepods 2
							Pro offer many of the perks we’ve come to know and
							love about these Oraimo buds, that is a killer sound
							quality, decent build, vast compatibility and all
							that at a relatively reasonable price.
						</p>
						<img
							src="./images/oraimo--6.jpg"
							alt="spec"
							class="riff-spec , article-img"
						/>
						<p>
							The sound quality is no match for the Freepods 3 or
							even the Freepods Pro but it is nothing to sneeze
							at. This pair is missing any form of active noice
							cancellation, but it comes with rubber ear tips that
							offer ‘environmental noice cancellation’.
							Essentially, it blocks out ambient noise.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-spec--6">
						<h3>Oraimo Freepods 2</h3>

						<p>
							The Freepods 2 come with a 13mm dynamic driver that
							delivers decent audio that is a little above average
							and for the common person, this is more than
							acceptable.
						</p>
						<img
							src="./images/oraimo--7.jpg"
							alt="spec"
							class="riff-spec , article-img"
						/>
						<p>
							My biggest gripe with these buds is the fact that it
							charges via micro-USB and not type-C. In 2022, USB-C
							is everywhere with all modern smartphones and even
							laptops charging with this universal, versatile
							port. I wouldn’t recommend these for that reason
							alone, if not for anything else.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, these buds have been in the market for some
							time now. This means that the tiny batteries in the
							buds and in the case have probably degraded more
							than all the newer models. Should you want these, be
							ready to deal with lucklaster or poor battery
							performance.
						</p>
						<p>Price: $22, <span>₦</span>9500</p>

						<h3 class="Conclusion-header">Conclusion</h3>
						<p>
							Oraimo is proving to be a force to reckon with when
							it comes to smart accessories and we’re here for it.
							The prices are also relatively friendly so that is a
							plus.
						</p>
						<p>
							These true wireless buds from Oraimo offer so much
							value for money and whichever one you pick, you’re
							bound to have a decent experience. Should your
							budget allow it, get the Oraimo Freepods Pro. Many
							have dubbed it the AirPods killer and that does
							account for something.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Freepods 3 remain a favorite for many as it
							strikes an incredible balance between good sound and
							affordable price. No wonder these are still in the
							market for over a year since they first debuted. The
							oraimo Riff is your go-to should you be on a budget.
						</p>
						<p>
							The older generation buds are also solid but the
							battery cells degrade over time, regardless of
							whether they’re being used or not. As such, I’d
							advise you to stay away from those and consider the
							Riff and Freepods 3.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you’re not a fan of the rubber ear tips, then the
							Roll with Tunes and Freepods 3 are your options. Or
							better yet, wait for a few months and you know
							Oraimo will have another TWS product.
